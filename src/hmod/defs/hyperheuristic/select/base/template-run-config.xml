        Configuration definition, related to a selection hyperheuristic. This
        file must be edited and used to particularise a hyperheuristic run.
        Any additional configuration entry (for example, the data required by
        custom operators) may be added in this file.

        Termination criteria configuration. The hyperheuristic will finish when
        at least one of the following criteria is meet during the search.
        - The 'selHyp_maxIteration' field specifies the maximum iterations to 
          execute for the algorithm's main body. Use -1 for infinite iterations.
        - The 'selHyp_maxSeconds' specifies the maximum execution seconds to 
          keep running the algorithm's main body. Use -1 for infinite time.
