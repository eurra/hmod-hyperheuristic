        Elite solutions max.:
            Defines how many elite solutions will be stored by the acceptance
            procedure. While bigger the value is, more cpu is required in
            each iteration, and a slower convergence can be expected. While 
            lower the value is, less cpu is required in each iteration, and a 
            faster convergence can be expected.
