        Oscillation modifier parameter:
            Defines how much time is spent on the intensification and 
            diversification zones in the search. This value ranges from 0 to 1,  
            and the bigger the value is, more abrupt is the change from 
            intensification to diversification.

        Strategy change speed:
            Defines how faster the transition from intensification to 
            diversification occurs. This value ranges from 0 to 1, and the 
            bigger the value is, less non-improving iterations are required to
            fall into the diversification zone.
