% Example file for executing the hyperheuristic attributive memory model 
% extension.
%
% This file provides an example to run a dial-a-ride problem alongside the 
% attributive memory hyperheuristic model.
%
% Remember that definition and batch files are highly customizable. This is
% only an example of the default hyperheuristic model load. Custom models
% would require additional components that must be specified an/or exemplified
% by their providers.
%
% Particularly, this file configures the environment to run the algorithm. The
% building itself is implemented in the 'build' file, which is called here.
%
% Run this file as:
%     'batch /hmod/defs/hyperheuristic/select/attr/example/run'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Some variables to use in the algorithm build
set BASE_PATH /hmod/defs/hyperheuristic/select/base
set ATTR_PATH /hmod/defs/hyperheuristic/select/attr
set DARPTW_PATH /hmod/defs/problems/darptw

% Algorithm build, implemented in other batch file
batch @ATTR_PATH@/example/build

% Start id configuration
start_id selHyp_main_01
