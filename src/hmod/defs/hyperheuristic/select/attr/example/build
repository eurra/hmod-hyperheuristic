% Example file for building the hyperheuristic attributive memory model 
% extension.
%
% This file provides an example to build the attributive memory hyperheuristic 
% model and a dial-a-ride problem domain.
%
% Remember that definition and batch files are highly customizable. This is
% only an example of the default hyperheuristic model load. Custom models
% would require additional components that must be specified an/or exemplified
% by their providers.
%
% Particularly, this file provides all the definitions required to build the
% model, allowing to load the algorithm in memory. This script do NOT launch
% the algorithm, see the 'main' batch file for this purpose. After running this 
% file, the algorithm may be executed directly by calling the 'run' command.
%
% This batch file uses two variables, which may be previously set:
%  - The BASE_PATH variable, which must hold the root path of the base 
%    hyperheuristic model definitions.
%  - The ATTR_PATH variable, which must hold the root path of the attributive 
%    hyperheuristic model definitions.
%  - The DARPTW_PATH variable, which must hold the root path of the darptw
%    problem definitions.
%
% Run this file as:
%     'batch /hmod/defs/hyperheuristic/select/attr/example/build'

% The attributive memory model works based on attribute processors at the domain
% barrier layer, which extract the attributes from the low-level for their usage
% at the high-level as relevant search information. A template file for the
